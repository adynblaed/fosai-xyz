## ðŸ¤” How-to-Use

Start by visualizing your learning and/or project goals and navigate through the content on the sidebars accordingly. Try not to get too caught up in the jargon, focus on getting software or projects running with workflows that encourage you to continue exploring this technology and its many possibilities. 

**Tips & Tricks**

**Take Your Time**

- There's no need to read everything at once. Pick and choose areas you'd like to focus on and revisit pages as many times as you need.

**Be Curious & Patient**

- Self-learning is a journey of exploration and discovery. Stay curious and be patient with yourself. Not everything will come easily, and that's okay. 

**Don't Forget to Have Fun!**

- Above all, don't forget to have fun! You're working with artificial intelligence. Less than ten years ago much of this was science fiction. Remind yourself that even though AI is in its early stages, it's here nonetheless.
