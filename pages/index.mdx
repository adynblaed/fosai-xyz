## FOSAI ▲ XYZ

**FOSAI** stands for **F**ree **O**pen-**S**ource **A**rtificial **I**ntelligence. 

FOSAI ▲ XYZ is a free and open-source resource that helps you learn and engage with cutting/bleeding-edge AI technologies in their trending categories: generative pre-trained transformers **(text-based AI)**, generative computer vision and image diffusion **(image-based AI)**, and generative audio/video synthesis **(audio & video-based AI)**.

FOSAI ▲ XYZ focuses on teaching you the basics of artificial intelligence and how to get started with free open-source software applications and platforms that empower you to run AI at home today. 

This wiki/handbook/codex/guide is updated frequently and is designed for anyone who can read english and follow instructions on a computer. Throughout your research and development remember that you are experimenting with bleeding-edge AI, results and experiences will vary.

## 🤔 How-to-Use

Start by visualizing your learning and/or project goals and navigate through the content on the sidebars accordingly. Try not to get too caught up in the jargon, focus on getting software or projects running with workflows that encourage you to continue exploring this technology and its many possibilities. 

If you're not sure where to begin [`Explore`](explore/projects) some of the projects you can get started with today.

**Tips & Tricks**

**Take Your Time**

- There's no need to read everything at once. Pick and choose areas you'd like to focus on and revisit pages as many times as you need.

**Be Curious & Patient**

- Learning is a journey of exploration and discovery. Stay curious and be patient with yourself. Not everything will come easily, and that's okay. 

**Don't Forget to Have Fun!**

- Above all, don't forget to have fun! You're working with artificial intelligence. Less than ten years ago much of this was science fiction. Remind yourself that even though AI is in its early stages, it's here nonetheless.
