## 🖼️ Image Diffusion Resources

These Free and Open-Source Software AI platforms provide the tools to run comprehensive image diffusion models on your individual servers, desktops, or laptops.

Each platform shares different advantages and stylizations. If you're unsure where to start, Stable Diffusion is a popular choice. Once you're acquainted with Stable Diffusion, you might want to venture into other platforms to broaden your exposure to video mediums and other image diffusion models and software.

Please note, the features and user experiences will vary across different platforms.

### [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI)
A powerful and modular stable diffusion GUI and backend. This new and powerful ui will let you design and execute advanced stable diffusion pipelines using a graph/nodes/flowchart based interface. 

---

### [ControlNet](https://github.com/lllyasviel/ControlNet)
ControlNet is a neural network structure to control diffusion models by adding extra conditions. This is a very popular and powerful extension to add to AUTOMATIC111's stable-diffusion-webui.
