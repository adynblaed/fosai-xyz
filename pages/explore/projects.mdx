## Explore Popular LLM Tools

**LangChain**: Build context-aware, reasoning applications with LangChain’s flexible abstractions and AI-first toolkit.

**LlamaIndex**: A simple, flexible data framework for connecting custom data sources to large language models.

**Chroma**: Chroma is the open-source embedding database. Chroma makes it easy to build LLM apps by making knowledge, facts, and skills pluggable for LLMs.

## Retrieval Augmented Generation

Follow any one of the videos or workflows below to dive into retrieval augmented generation (RAG). With RAG, you can give your chatbot or language model long term memory and extended context lengths with abilities to retrieve and augment responses based on an index or vectorbase you build from your content.

## NVIDIA NeMo

Follow any one of the videos or workflows below to dive into NVIDIA's new `colang` language and `NeMo Guardrails` library. This unique approach is worth your time if you need to align your model with specific functions and interactions. Keep an eye on `colang`.

## Self-Development

### Learn Faster w/ AI Tutors & Teaching Assistants

Design and chat with your own AI tutor to help understand the contents of this site.

- 1.) Draft a prompt for a personal tutor / assistant persona. 
- 2.) Choose a model accessible to you (GPT-3.5, Open-Source, etc.) and get it running on a text-based platform of choice.
- 3.) One-Shot prompt the model with your prompt and see how it responds. 
- 4.) Begin asking it questions pertinent to your topic or goal. 
- 5.) Start copy/pasting contents from this site into the model and ask it to teach you w/ custom methods or explanations.  

### Organize Yourself w/ AI Interns & Project Managers

One AI not enough? Design and chat with an entire staff of AI assistants, interns, and project managers to help organize your thoughts, projects, or notes.

- 1.) Draft a prompt for a project manager and team of assistants. 
- 2.) Choose a model accessible to you (GPT-3.5, Open-Source, etc.) and get it running on a text-based platform of choice.
- 3.) One-Shot prompt the model with your prompt and see how it responds. 
- 4.) Begin asking it questions pertinent to your topic or goal, try asking members of your group or team and see if the model picks up the multiple personas. 
- 5.) Organize your digital files, notes, or goals with the assistance of the project manager and team. Combine this prompt with the your personal learning assistant to multiply how many angles and perspectives you can infer with at a given time. 

### Chat w/ Notes, Articles, Files, and Documentation

Feed your text-based content to a LLM and 'chat' with the contents of your file or resource.

- 1.) Find an open-source chat document Q&A program from my [GitHub Stars](https://github.com/adynblaed?tab=stars) and see if you can get a platform installed and running. 
- 2.) Choose a model accessible to you (GPT-3.5, Open-Source, etc.)
- 3.) Upload your document(s) to the software platform or build your own pipeline w/ something like [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) or [Llamaindex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/).
- 4.) Begin asking your document questions pertinent to your topic or research goal! 
- 5.) Upload more documents and reindex vectors as needed.
