Don't feel limited to this list. These are just a few starting points. Get creative! The applications are limitless. 

## Self-Development

### **Learn Faster w/ AI Tutors & Teaching Assistants**

Design and chat with your own AI tutor to help understand the contents of this site.

- 1.) Draft a prompt for a personal tutor / assistant persona. 
- 2.) Choose a model accessible to you (GPT-3.5, Open-Source, etc.)
- 3.) One-Shot prompt the model with your written draft and see how it responds. 
- 4.) Begin asking it questions pertinent to your topic or goal. 
- 5.) Start copy/pasting contents from this site into the model and ask it to teach you w/ custom methods or explanations.  

### **Organize Yourself w/ AI Interns & Project Managers**

One AI not enough? Design and chat with an entire staff of AI assistants, interns, and project managers to help organize your thoughts, projects, or notes.

- 1.) Draft a prompt for a project manager and team of assistants. 
- 2.) Choose a model accessible to you (GPT-3.5, Open-Source, etc.)
- 3.) One-Shot prompt the model with your written draft and see how it responds. 
- 4.) Begin asking it questions pertinent to your topic or goal, try asking members of your group or team and see if the model picks up the multiple personas. 
- 5.) Organize your digital files, notes, or goals with the assistance of the project manager and team. Combine this prompt with the your personal learning assistant to multiply how many angles and perspectives you can infer with at a given time. 

### **Chat w/ Notes, Articles, Files, and Documentation**

Feed your text-based content to a LLM and 'chat' with the contents of your file or resource.

- 1.) Find an open-source chat document Q&A program from my [GitHub Stars](https://github.com/adynblaed?tab=stars) and see if you can get a platform installed and running. 
- 2.) Choose a model accessible to you (GPT-3.5, Open-Source, etc.)
- 3.) Upload your document(s) to the software platform or build your own pipeline w/ something like [Llamaindex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/)
- 4.) Begin asking your document questions pertinent to your topic or research goal! 
- 5.) Upload more documents and reindex vectors as needed.  

## Fun & Games

**Chat With Fictional Characters**
- Chat with fictional characters from video games, stories, or points in time far before our own. Just prompt the model and ask it to be whoever you want it to be!  

**Play Semantic Mini Games**
- Chat with AI to play text-based role-playing mini games (riddles, puzzles, jokes, etc.)

**Custom Characters & Personas**
- Chat with any character you can think of or design within a prompt (or custom workflow). 

These are just few of many... Get creative, join communities and share ideas!
