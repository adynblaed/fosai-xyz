# Concepts
This page casually explores some of the deeper concepts behind AI.  

## General Concepts

### 1. Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)
Artificial General Intelligence refers to a type of artificial intelligence that is as smart as a human across the boardâ€”a machine capable of understanding or learning any intellectual task that a human being can. It is the type of AI that, many believe, could lead to a Singularity.

### 2. Exponential Growth
One of the key concepts behind the Singularity is the idea of exponential growth in technology. The term "Moore's Law" is often used to describe this, referring to the observation that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles about every two years. This concept applies to AI, as the capabilities of AI systems have been growing exponentially.

### 3. Superintelligence
Superintelligence refers to a form of AI that surpasses human intelligence not just in one aspect but across virtually all areas of practical importance. It's thought that once AGI is achieved, the leap to superintelligence could occur rapidly due to recursive self-improvement, causing a "Singularity."

### 4. Recursive Self-Improvement
Recursive self-improvement is the concept that an AI system could make improvements to itself, thereby increasing its intelligence. This increased intelligence would allow it to make further improvements, leading to a rapid increase in intelligence, or an "intelligence explosion", another key concept tied to the Singularity.

### 5. Technological Singularity
The Technological Singularity, often simply called the Singularity, refers to a hypothetical future point in time when technological growth becomes uncontrollable and irreversible, leading to unfathomable changes to human civilization. This is often associated with the concept of AGI reaching a point of superintelligence.

## Machine Learning Concepts

### 1. Supervised Learning
Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on a labeled dataset. That is, for every input in the training data, the correct output is known and the model is trained to predict the output for given inputs.

### 2. Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning is another type of machine learning where the model learns from an unlabeled dataset. The model identifies patterns and relationships in the data without being explicitly told what to look for.

### 3. Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize some notion of cumulative reward. The agent learns from trial and error, gradually improving its actions based on the rewards it receives.

### 4. Neural Networks
Neural networks are a type of model used in machine learning, inspired by the human brain. They consist of layers of nodes (or "neurons"), with each node in a layer connected to every node in the next layer. Each connection has a weight, and these weights are what the model learns from the data.

### 5. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
Convolutional Neural Networks are a special type of neural network designed for processing structured grid data such as images. They are particularly effective at identifying spatial hierarchies or patterns.

### 6. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
Recurrent Neural Networks are a type of neural network designed for processing sequential data. They are used extensively in tasks involving time series data, like stock price prediction, or natural language processing tasks.

### 7. Transfer Learning
Transfer Learning is a machine learning method where a pretrained model is used on a new problem. It's a popular method in deep learning because it can train deep neural networks with comparatively little data.

### 8. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
Generative Adversarial Networks are a type of unsupervised learning technique, which leverages two neural networks: a generator, which learns to generate new data mimicking some distribution; and a discriminator, which learns to differentiate between the generated and real data.

### 9. Overfitting and Underfitting
Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, capturing not only the underlying patterns but also the noise. Underfitting is when a model is too simple and doesn't capture the underlying patterns of the data.

### 10. Regularization
Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function. The penalty term discourages the model from learning overly complex patterns in the training data, promoting better generalization to unseen data.
