This website should be considered a wiki, documentation hub, and learning platform for AI technology at the bleeding edges of free open-source software (FOSS) and free open-source artificial intelligence (FOSAI). 

The goal of this resource is to condense all of the information you need to get started with machine learning, deep learning, and free open-source artificial intelligence software in ways that are practical and pragmatic to your goals and aspirations.

Unlock the potential of your future with FOSAI.
