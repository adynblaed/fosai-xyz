## Teach Yourself Machine Learning

This is a roadmap and resource pool to become a self-developed professional in Machine Learning, starting from the basics and working all the way up to advanced concepts. 

Pick and choose what you want to learn. You don't have to do them all. Learn your own pace, before, during, or alongside your journey developing and interacting with AI.
